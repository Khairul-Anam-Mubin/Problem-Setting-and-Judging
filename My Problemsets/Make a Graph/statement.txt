Given N nodes, let's denote each of the i'th node contains value Ai. 
Consider an edge between two nodes i , j where i != j and (1 <= i , j <= N) if the value of the nodes Ai and Aj share common factors. 

We don't want to make trouble with that graph. So just let us know the number of connected components in that graph.

Input statement:

The first line contains one integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100) — the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains one integers N where (1 <= N <= 105) — the number of nodes.

The second line contains N integers A1, A2, ..., AN (0 ≤ Ai ≤ 106) - the value of the i'th node.

Output Statement:

For each case you have to print a line consisting the case number and the number of connected components. 
Look at the sample output for exact format.
