Let's be straight. You are given N number of strings, i'th of them is Si. Also you are given Q queries. In each query, you will be given a string T. You have to tell how many ways you can make that string T from a given string set S. Consider that you can take any string Si zero or more times.

Sample Input: 
The first line contains one integer N - the number of given set of strings. Then N lines follows.

Each of the ith lines contains one string Si.

After taking the set of strings S, there is an another integer Q - the number of queries. Then Q lines follows.

Each of the ith lines contains one string T - the string you have to make from the given set of string S.

Constraints:

1 <= N <= 100

1 <= Q <= 100

|Si| = 10^4

T = |Ti| = 10^4
Sample Output: 
For each query, output one integer - the number of ways.
